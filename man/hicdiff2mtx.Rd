\title{Converts significance maps to dense matrices.}
\usage{
hicdiff2mtx(
  hicdiff.list,
  maps.dims,
  val.column = c("qvalue", "pvalue")[1],
  neg.log = TRUE,
  which.enrichment = c("both", "x", "y")[1]
)
}
\arguments{
\item{hicdiff.list}{list of data frames, output from \code{\link{hicdiff}} function}

\item{maps.dims}{list of data frames, usually an attribute of HiCglm object that was used to produce hicdiff.list}

\item{val.column}{character indicating which column of sparse significance map to use as cell value for dense matrix (either pvalue or qvalue)}

\item{neg.log}{logical wheter to apply -log transformation to val.column}

\item{which.enrichment}{character indicating whether to calculate Y enrichment (i.e. E[Y | X] model) - choose y, X enrichment (i.e. E[X | Y] model) - choose x or both}
}
\value{
list with dense matrices containing significance in each cell; when which.enrichment is fixed to both upper triangular map will contain significances of E[Y | X] model and lower triangular will contain significances of E[X | Y]
}
\description{
Given list of significance maps in sparse format produced by \code{\link{hicdiff}} function converts them to dense matrix format.
