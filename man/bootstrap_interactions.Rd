\title{Hi-C interactions bootstrapping.}
\usage{
bootstrap_interactions(interactions, ratio = c(0.5, 0.5),
  with.replacement = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{interactions}{data frame containing row with i and j coordinate for every single interaction}

\item{ratio}{numeric vector indicating on how many atomic interaction sets should initial atomic interaction set be divided; each entry of ratio vector contains fraction of interaction to be put in corresponding atomic interactions set; ratio vector must sum to 1 and all its entries must be larger than one}
}
\value{
data frame representing sparse Hi-C maps (with i, j, val columns) belonging to corresponding bootstrapped interactions subset - ratio.number column indicates index of fraction from ratio vector
}
\description{
Randomly samples interactions from data frame with atomic interactions into \code{length(ratio)} data frames with interactions in such a way that i-th dataframe have \code{ratio[i]} fraction of interactions of initial atomic interactions data frame.
}
\examples{
# create data frame with artificial interactions, where val
# indicates total number of interactions between bins i and j
sparse.mtx <- data.frame(i = c(1,3,5,7,8,9,11), j = c(7,2,1,1,3,10,9), val = c(10,8,3,1,1,2,20))
atomic.interactions <- sparse2interactions(sparse.mtx)
print(head(atomic.interactions))
b1 <- bootstrap_interactions(atomic.interactions)
print(b1)
ratios.desired <- c(0.4,0.3,0.2,0.1)
b2 <- bootstrap_interactions(atomic.interactions, ratio = ratios.desired)
print(b2)
sum.interactions <- nrow(atomic.interactions)
ratios.sampled <- sapply(split(b2, b2$ratio.number), function(x){ sum(x$val) / sum.interactions })
print(ratios.desired)
print(ratios.sampled)
